# Hands-On Machine Learning with SKLearn, Keras, Tensorflow
This is my working repo for O'Reilly Hands-On Machine Learning with SKLearn, Keras, and Tensorflow2 (2nd Edition)

I absolutely LOVED the first edition of this book, so decided to work through the second one chapter by chapter for review and practice.
